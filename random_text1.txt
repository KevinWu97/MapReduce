The T-34, a Soviet medium tank, had a profound effect on the conflict on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, and had a lasting impact on tank design. When introduced in 1940, the T-34 had an unprecedented balance of firepower, mobility, protection and ruggedness. Its 76.2 mm (3 in) high-velocity tank gun was more powerful than its contemporaries[5] while its 60 degree sloped armour provided good protection against anti-tank weapons. The sloped armor and Christie suspension were inherited from the design of American Walter Christie’s M1928 tank, versions of which were sold turret-less to the Red Army and documented as “farm tractors”, after being rejected by the U.S. Army.[6] After the Germans encountered the tank in 1941, German general Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist called it "the finest tank in the world"[7] and Heinz Guderian affirmed the T-34's "vast superiority" over German tanks.[8][9] "As early as July 1941, OKW chief Alfred Jodl noted in his war diary the surprise at this new and thus unknown wunder-armament being unleashed against the German assault divisions."[10]. Although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war, it has been described as the most influential tank design of the war.[11]

The T-34 was the mainstay of Soviet armoured forces throughout the war. Its general specifications remained nearly unchanged until late 1944, when it received a firepower upgrade with the introduction of the greatly improved T-34/85 variant. Its production method was continuously refined to meet the needs of the Eastern Front, making the T-34 quicker and cheaper to produce. The Soviets ultimately built over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German Wehrmacht.[12] Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/55 series).[13] With 44,900 lost during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses ever.[14] Its development led directly to the T-54 and T-55 series of tanks, which in turn evolved into the later T-62, T-72, and T-90 that form the armoured core of many modern armies. T-34 variants were widely exported after World War II, and as recently as 2018 more than 130 were still in service.[15]
